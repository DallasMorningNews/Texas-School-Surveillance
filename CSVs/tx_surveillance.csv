What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? In our continued efforts to keep our students safe, AISD purchased content monitoring software, GoGuardian and Gaggle, without any instigating incidents.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.)
On district-owned technological devices, GoGuardian software proactively identifies students at risk of self-harm. Gaggle is another student safety solution that is used to filter and monitor safe learning online. Students use Google products for Education, issued by AISD, consisting of Gmail, Meet, Calendar, Drive for storage, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms and Sites such as Canvas.
Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it?
Yes, we still use this technology because we find great value in both systems. We respond to students efficiently based on unsafe keywords that Gaggle and GoGuardian use to alert the Threat Assessment Coordinator. Both products have the ability to prioritize student needs by alert levels. The Threat Assessment Coordinator receives alerts for students that are both virtual and in-person. Alerts consist of drugs and alcohol, harassment, nudity, self-harm, and violence towards others.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members?
The technology is used with all students in the District.
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email?
No.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""?
Parents received a copy of AISD ‘s Gaggle and GoGuardian Policy, as well as the Acceptable Usage Policy, outlining appropriate usage. A series of online community meetings were held throughout last year to inform parents and community members about the District’s monitoring policy. Students nor parents could “opt-out” of monitoring student’s activity on district-issued technology devices or while logged into their district issued Google account.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials?
Please see the below documents and Links:
    - Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
    - Normas de Usa Aceptable (AUP)
    - Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA)
    - Internet Safety Plan for Austin ISD
    - FFH Board Policy
    - FFI Board Policy
    - Gaggle/GoGuardian
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology?
The Threat Assessment Coordinator, AISD Police Department, Principals, Assistant Principals, Professional School Counselors, and Licensed Mental Health Professionals.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm?
We have seen a strong impact of these tools to protect our students. However, due to the sensitive nature of the incidents and for student privacy, we are unable to share information related to these events.""  -Cristina Nguyen, Senior Communications Sepcialist"

Who recommended it to you? What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology?  The Safety and Security team and Counseling Department wanted to take a proactive, preventative approach to the overall wellness of students and keeping children safe. Gaggle is one of the providers of preventative services that allow districts to be alerted to written statements made by students which indicate they are at risk.   There was no specific instigating incident that made the team purchase technology.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) Securely (sic) is used as a mobile device management platform. We utilize it to manage the application and settings on all district iPads, and provide teachers with a classroom management tool. They have the ability to lock student devices to either be disabled or restricted to a certain website during class. This functionality is disabled outside of school hours. Gaggle is utilized to monitor CFB issued student email or Google Drive accounts and send alerts based on certain types of content, such as pornography, or treats of violence or self-harm.    
Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? Yes. It continues to alert us to students at risk of imminent harm.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members? All students only
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? Designated staff monitor social media.  We also use Meltwater services as a monitoring device.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""? Yes. Notification of monitoring is in the CFBISD Student Responsible Technology Use Guidelines. Parents agree to this form when enrolling their student each year.  The only opt out available, is an opt out of using district technology altogether.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? CQ (Local) and CQ (Legal) FFF (Legal and Local) FFEB (Legal)FFB (Legal)FFH (Legal and Local)Student Handbook (pages 46-47)
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? Gaggle: The District Gaggle Team, a subgroup of the District Threat Assessment Team, as members of the Safe and Supportive Schools Program receive Gaggle alerts.  Processes are in place to coordinate the appropriate response based on the type of Gaggle alert and the content reported. 
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? There have been multiple incidents in which students at risk have been identified and imminent self-harm was avoided.  Incidents include letters with students saying good-bye to loved ones with plans to take one’s life, detailed plans of minors to run away and meet individuals they have met online, and plans to self-injure.  
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? Gaggle: We use this technology to manage the student accounts and data through filters programmed to check data against certain key words in order to identify possible signs of suicide ideation, self-harm, harm to others, signs of depression, exploitation, bullying, and inappropriate content that is in violation of the student use of technology agreement. This is in an effort to align the in-person school safety culture with the online learning environment.
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances. Students who are found in possession of inappropriate content on their district technology or accounts are referred to campus administrators for appropriate disciplinary procedures aligned with district policies."" - Dawn Parnell, Chief Communications Officer"

The system monitors high school students’ district email and files in their Google Drive, as well as middle school students’ Google Drive files. Campus and district leaders who would be involved in incident response (such as principal, counselor, etc.) have access to the reports and alerts relevant to them.

Who recommended it to you? What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? As a school district, we are required to maintain a content filter for our Internet traffic to meet CIPA compliance. We learned about Securly in 2017 and took it for a test drive! We were impressed with many of its features and ease of use, and implemented it a few months later.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) Securly is used for our content filter. It also has the ability to identify certain triggers in our student email and will forward those triggers (verbiage that includes weapons, fights, bullying, suicidal expression, etc.) This product also allows us to place our lost/stolen/unreturned devices in LOST mode which will shut down access and provide us with a GPS locator.   
Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? We still use this product.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members? This is used for all Internet traffic and all Chromebooks.
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? We have used Social Sentinel for social media monitoring.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""? There is not an ""opt out"" for content filtering as it is a requirement for districts to utilize content filtering or lose E-Rate funding.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? This technology is implemented and managed by the Executive Director of Technology and the Network Administrator. No one else has access to the back end of the content filtering/monitoring functionality.
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? Please see Q#7. When Securly sends a notification regarding a self-harm or harm-to-others concern, the Executive Director of Technology forwards the alert to the proper campus administrators for follow-up.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? I KNOW that this service has alerted us to several students talking about and/or threatening self-harm. I firmly believe that our interventions have prevented multiple tragedies.  
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? We piloted Securly Classroom last spring and plan to implement this fall. It is an add-on module, totally separate from the content filter, that provides teachers with the ability to see and lock their students' Chromebook screens while they are giving instructions, and provides an easier way to push out URLs for instruction. During the pilot phase, it greatly increased students' time on task and minimized their tendency to open non-instructional websites.
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances. Securly has not led to any disciplinary actions in our school district."" -Travis Young, Assistant Superintendant of Student Services"

GoGuardian: Why: Provided to assist classroom teachers with monitoring and keep students on  task during online instructional activities. Who: Instructional Technology became aware of the product during a session  presented by GoGuardian at a Texas Compute Educators Association (TCEA) Conference. What: Teachers had expressed concern about how to monitor and manage student  use of online instructional resources.
Gaggle: Why: To assist with limiting: potential predatory contact, child pornography, threats  of violence and gun violence, mental-health crises (social-emotional), and  suicide threats. Who: Instructional Technology in conjunction with the Technology Department  reviewed the product and determined that it would help provide administrative staff with information for appropriate decision-making.ContentKeeper Why: In order to receive the FCC’s E-Rate discounts for Category 1 and Category 2  services, the District is required to certify that we maintain content filtering  services on a yearly basis. This is known as the Children’s Internet Protection  Act (CIPA) requirement. This service provides a granular, age appropriate control of specific web applications and filters out inappropriate content. Who: A system of this type has been in place since the District received its first E Rate Discounts in 1998. What: In addition to requiring this to certify our District for E-Rate, it also helps keep  students on task and safe during online instruction.
2. What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email  monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc.  Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.)
GoGuardian: What: Interacts with any/all content the student uses during the class period(s). Functionality: Teachers can use this to supplement the content filtering provided by ContentKeeper if they notice inappropriate sites, and may also use it to keep  children on task during class. Gaggle: What: Monitors and reports on the content of student classroom based: Gmail, Google Drive, Google Hangouts, Google Calendaring, and Google App Content  where they include: potential predatory contact, child pornography, threats  of violence and gun violence, mental-health crises (social-emotional), and  suicide threats. ContentKeeper: What: Monitors any/all requests to the web. Functionality: Blocks access to inappropriate material using heuristics, global  feedback, custom local access policies, and provides role-based permissions  based on user type and grade level.
3. Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it?
GoGuardian: Yes – we still use this and are renewing it for an additional year. It’s still worth it as it  allows the teacher to keep the students engaged and on-task. Gaggle: Yes – we still use this and are renewing it for an additional year. Ensuring that  students who are having issues receive assistance, and that students are kept safe  from violence, self-harm and other threatening situations is at the core of what we  do and this tool helps us address these situations proactively. ContentKeeper: Yes – it helps keep students away from inappropriate material, and is require to  receive discounts for internet access, wide-area network and infrastructure  equipment discounts from the FCC’s E-Rate program.
4. Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any  employees or community members? GoGuardian: This is used only by classroom teachers and campus administrators to monitor  online student activities. Gaggle: This product only monitors District sponsored Google Classroom and related accounts information. ContentKeeper: Applies to all students and staff. Access to web content varies depending on grade level. Staff and administration have a bit broader access in order to conduct business. This is also applied to students at home, when using District supplied devices.
5. Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go  Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring  students' social media or email? GoGuardian: Yes – Teachers use to track websites that a student visits for inappropriate and  unsuitable content during student in-classroom online activity. Gaggle: Yes – Social media or email that is tied to their Everman ISD/Google Classroom account. ContentKeeper: Yes – All content retrieved from the web.
6. Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this  technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""? ContentKeeper: Yes – The District was required to provide a public reading at the board meeting during their first year of E-Rate requests (1998).  No – Students and Parents may not opt-out as E-Rate program rules require this be  in place to continue to receive discounts on Internet Access. Policy CQ addresses this in the section titled “Children’s Internet Protect Act.” Additionally, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act when purchasing computers not covered by CIPA  required content filtering. Finally, this is part of the Student, and Employee  Acceptable Use Policy and Codes of Conduct. Everman ISD applies content filtering  to all campuses and even to student connectivity when using District devices at  home or outside the District Network.
7. What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by  District officials?
GoGuardian: The District’s Employee Acceptable Use Policy combined with a structured set of  system controls are in place to prevent access to information by unauthorized staff  outside of the local campus/classroom jurisdiction. Gaggle: The District’s Employee Acceptable Use Policy combined with a structured set of  system controls are in place to prevent access to information by unauthorized staff.  See Exhibit A for specific information on who has access to information which is  escalated to staff as needing immediate attention. Access by users to reports is  logged by date and time.

""Parents were notified of the use of Gaggle in the general safety letter sent home.  I have included the information from the letter (this was last year's letter):
  The following are just some of the steps we implement to ensure that our learning environments are as safe and secure as possible: ● Lockdown, evacuation, shelter, and fire emergency drills are practiced a minimum of once per semester to ensure readiness for a variety of scenarios. ● School Resource Officers are assigned at campuses. ● Visitor entry to schools is limited to secured main entrances that require entry through the main office. ● STOPIt Anonymous Reporting App available to students, staff, and parents. ● Gaggle network monitoring system. ● Camera surveillance  
No parents can't opt-out of Gaggle network monitoring.

Go Guardian is part of the monitoring and acceptable use policy when using EISD equipment."" -Nikita Russell, Executive Director of Public Relations"

What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? Response #1 - There was no instigating incident that caused Irving ISD to purchase Gaggle. Irving ISD is and has always been very concerned with the health and safety of our students. This concern was the reason why Irving ISD started investigating applications that would allow us to proactively assist in preventing student self-harm, violence to others, and Drug & Alcohol abuse. We were looking for a solution that would be secure, accurate, low maintenance, and easy to use. The Gaggle solution met Irving ISD’s requirements and expectations.

What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) Response #2 - Gaggle helps ensure the safety of our children by looking for signs of students who may be struggling with suicide ideation or self-harm, issues with child abuse, drugs and alcohol, pornography, harassment, bullying, or possible violence.  They monitor our district-provided Google online environments for both email and Google Drive, alerting us when a child is in crisis so we can help them get any intervention they may need.

Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? Response #3 - Yes, we still use this product because it has been very productive and beneficial. We have been able to notify many parents and guardians of issues (and potential issues) that resulted in them getting their children connected with community resources and counseling services.

Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members? Response #4 - Yes, this application is used on all students. It is NOT used on employees or community members.

Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? Response #5 – Irving ISD has used/is using/will continue to use various technology tools to safeguard the health and safety of our students. This includes using tools to ensure that our district-sponsored technology resources and platforms are being used properly and in compliance with district policies and governmental laws and regulations.

Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""? Response #6 – As stated above the district uses various technology tools to safeguard the health and safety of our students. The district updates and releases a Student Code of Conduct and an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) each year. Each year parents / guardians acknowledges that they take the responsibility for adhering to the contents of these documents and that they have or will read the documents to their children. These agreements emphasize that: Email Access – Access to district-provided online service (including email) is a privilege and not a right. These documents also emphasizes that student “e-mail is not confidential and may be monitored to ensure appropriate use” . Parent Options – These documents reiterate that “Any parent wishing to restrict their children’s access to any district computer online services will provide this restriction request in writing.”

What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? Response #7 – Irving ISD’s District policies (specifically, CQ (Local) and  CQ (Legal)) provide the provisions for the district to implement an Internet Safety Policy that addresses “The safety and security of minors when using electronic mail, chat rooms, and other forms of direct electronic communications;”.

Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? Response #8 – Access is limited to specific relevant staff  on a “Need-to-Know” basis.

Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? Response #9 – Yes, Gaggle has been able to identify instances of imminent violence and possible self-harm. Of course, this information is confidential and protected. 

Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? Response #10 – Yes, this tool has also been very helpful in identifying potential drug and alcohol use, bullying, sexual assault, and child pornography.

Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances. Response #11 – No."" - Jill Peeples, Director of Marketing and Communications"

GoGuardian was purchased as part of our security protection for students to be able to CIPA filter student devices as required by law. After researching multiple programs and doing some trials, we decided GoGuardian provided the best protection and monitoring capability for our district's needs. Social Sentinel was purchased as another piece of our security protection for our students to monitor Social Media posts in our area to notify us if any SM post mentioned any kind of threat to our schools.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) GoGuardian has multiple pieces: A CIPA web filter for district Chromebooks that are checked out to students for both on campus and at home protection, Theft Recovery in the event a Chromebook is stolen or missing, and web history tracking. A Chromebook Monitor for teachers to use during their class times that allows teachers to monitor student activity during the class to aid in keeping students on task. A monitor of student activity that can notify us if a student is either writing about or researching suicide or self-harm. Social Sentinel is a social media monitor.
Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? GoGuardian: We do still use GoGuardian. It does a great job protecting students via the CIPA filter, aides teachers during class time to monitor students and keep them on task, and provides a layer of protection and prevention of student self-harm and suicide. Social Sentinel: We are discussing at this time as to whether the system provided enough actionable information to merit continuing to use it.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members? GoGuardian: Used on all District owned Chromebooks, whether used by students or staff. Staff filters are not as strict as student filters, but are still a minimum of CIPA filtering. Social Sentinel: Is not used on any specific group, it merely monitors all social media that mentions potential harm to any of our schools. 
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? We also use a web filter within our network to protect all staff and students internet browsing.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""? Parents and students are informed annually that we use GoGuardian and our web filter for their protection as required by CIPA and State Law. We have an Acceptable Use Policy that all parents must sign that informs them that we filter all internet access. The only way to ""opt out"" is for a parent to choose not to allow their student internet access, which will then not allow that student to use a computing device for school work, but would instead force that student to only be able to use paper assignments. 
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? We have an Acceptable Use Policy in place for all staff. Beyond that we do have procedures for the staff to follow when using this technology.
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? GoGuardian: The Director of Technology manages these programs and receives alerts and reports. Campus Principals also receive alerts involving students who are attempting to access sites that are against filtering policies, and Counselors receive alerts of potential self-harm and suicide. As needed, the Director of Technology shares information with the Superintendent, Principals, Assistant Principals, and Counselors based on the individual situation. Social Sentinel: Alerts are sent to the Director of Technology. If there is an actionable threat, the appropriate Administrators and Officials are contacted.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? GoGuardian: We have received potential self-harm notifications that allowed Administrators to contact parents and intervene and get help for students who were contemplating self-harm. These have even come over a weekend and allowed notification of the parents to prevent the possible self-harm while students weren't at school. Social Sentinel: While there have been no actual threats that have been reported, we have received reports of social media mentions of our city or school in conjunction with terminology that appeared violent or threatening to the school, but was actually slang being used in reference to other events such as sporting events. Ex. ""yo Kirbyville is killin' it""
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? GoGuardian: Allows us to track missing or stolen devices in order to locate and attempt to recover them. Social Sentinel: No
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances. GoGuardian: Yes, if a student is attempting to access sites or information that is in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy or the Student Code of Conduct, or if a student is misusing the technology or bullying others, then they are contacted by an Assistant Principal or Principal to discuss the situation and administer disciplinary action as needed. Social Sentinel: No"

Social Sentinel monitors public social media accounts by geographical area and accounts associated with our campuses. Any individual (student, staff, parent or community member) who publicly makes threatening statements and is associated with the District (geographical area, tagged the District, etc.) may be reported.
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? Lamar CISD utilizes SchoolMessenger SafeMail Human Monitoring System (HMS) to filter and monitor students’ District-supplied email accounts. In addition to filtering, HMS identifies student emails that may contain student emergencies such as mentions of suicide, violence, sexuality and conflict.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""? The District’s use of Social Sentinel has been promoted through print and digital newsletters and safety overview videos posted on the District’s website and social media accounts. There is no “opt out” process, as Social Sentinel only uses publicly available data.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? The District does not have policies in place to specifically govern the use of Social Sentinel, however, Lamar CISD does have general policies for the Board, students and staff on acceptable technology use and internet safety.
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? The Lamar CISD Police Department, the District’s Director of Student Services and the Director of Community Relations.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? Yes, there have been multiple instances where Social Sentinel has identified threats of self-harm from students and our Student Services staff have intervened.
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? No, the District has only used this technology to prevent acts of violence or self-harm.
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances. To date, no Lamar CISD student has been disciplined as a result of reports from Social Sentinel."" -Lindsey Sayers, Community Relations Director"

While in theory this was a positive concept, the use of AI (artificial intelligence) left it up to a system to determine the need for intervention.  At the end of the pilot, it was determined that the best method of support for students and families was direct contact at school, teaching and modeling “see something, say something” and rich community resources to connect students and families to for support when not at school (i.e. tip lines, 24 hour hotlines, mental health resources). In addition, we replaced this software with an app that students utilize as a digital mood meter. The outcome of a student sharing how they are feeling triggers both supportive content by way of a 1–2-minute video on pro-social, healthy coping skills as well as triggering an alert for the counselor to check in with that student and see what level of support is needed. While Lewisville ISD has a rich and well-developed protocol for reactive situations, we also firmly believe in the benefit of teaching prevention skills as a protective factor. That drove our decision to discontinue use of the Social Sentinel software."" -Amanda Brim, Chief Communications Officer"

Securly is our content filter that is installed on all our district owned devices. The purpose is to filter websites that could be harmful to students and it does monitor for certain keywords when students are searching using words that have to do with self-harm or violence.  

Securely gives us the ability to block or allow websites depending on the need of the District and certain categories of sites are automatically blocked for students.   Things like pornography, dating, gambling and some shopping sites, for example, are some sites that Securly automatically blocks.  It is used primarily as a preventative tool and not a monitoring tool.

What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? The District purchased Gaggle eight years ago to support the district's implementation of Google Applications for Education and to provide an extra layer of protection for our students by filtering data of student accounts. We consider it an additional safety tool to help identify student concerns and to assist with directing the appropriate resources to address issues such as suicidal ideation, self-harm, bullying, inappropriate content, and exploitation. The District learned about the technology and felt it would be beneficial after seeing a need for the technology in response to incidents as mentioned above.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) Gaggle monitors students use of Google Suite of applications including Gmail and Google docs, flagging key words. Gaggle scans students using their gmail and Google drive irregardless if they are using a district provided or personal device.
Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? The District currently uses Gaggle. 
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members?
All students. If a student is logged into their Gmail/Google drive regardless of device, the information is monitored. 
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? We have used Social Sentinel in the past for social media monitoring, but are not currently using it.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""? The student handbook states: We believe that the tools provided by the G Suite for Education closely align with international standards for technology integration as well as with our state and district standards. For instructional and administrative purposes, students are automatically given access to G Suite for Education accounts on the first day of school. In RRISD, G Suite for Education runs on an internet domain owned by RRISD and is intended for educational use only. All student email and the contents of student-created Google documents in Google Drive are actively monitored by RRISD staff and third-party contracted services. As a cloud-based suite, G Suite for Education will be available at school and at home via the web. RRISD uses a robust content filter, but, with all online activity, there is always a chance a student could be exposed to inappropriate content.
All students/parents sign a technology use agreement that describes that the technology will be used to monitor activity for the purposes of cyber security in an attempt to keep the educational environment, online and in person, as safe as possible. The main focus for the District in using these systems is to stay as up to date as possible in monitoring the wellbeing of the whole child, including mental wellness and online safety.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials?
All users are required to acknowledge receipt and understanding of all administrative regulations governing the use of the District’s technology resources and shall agree in writing to allow monitoring of their use and to comply with such regulations and guidelines. 
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? The Chief of Police, Director of Behavioral Health, and the Associate Director of Administrative Projects. Campus administrators and counselors have access to the alerts for their campus. 
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? There is a documented case where a student planned to die by suicide one weekend in their home. The student logged into their student account and wrote a farewell letter, drafting individual goodbyes to each family member. Gaggle caught it based on keywords and an actual person from Gaggle notified safety & security. Local law enforcement was immediately contacted and requested to conduct a welfare check at the student's home. The student admitted to being bullied, had the means available, and was actively planning to die by suicide.
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? Gaggle can alert us if a student is sharing pornographic images. 
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances. Investigations of Gaggle Alerts have led to student/parent conferences, suspension of computer access, and other consequences as found in our student code of conduct."" - Jenny LaCoste-Caputo, Chief of Public Affairs and Communications"

Who recommended it to you? What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? The technology was purchased to use for one year – from approximately February 2017 to February 2018.  It was for a Migrant Education Program student device initiative intended to provide out of district web content filtering.  Our team met with McAllen ISD representatives, as they were using it at the time, to discuss their implementation of the technology. There were no incidents that prompted the purchase of this technology.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) Our use of the technology was limited to the following:  web filtering, web history tracking, location tracking, and social media monitoring.
Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? No.  The Migrant Education Program did not renew the service.  The cost was one of the determining factors.  Another was that the school district’s web content filter was updated to support out of district filtering so there was no need for two filtering services.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members? It was used only for the Migrant Education Program’s “one to one” student device initiative through which migrant students were supplied with either an Apple Macbook Pro or an iPad.  Other district students and staff were not filtered or monitored by this technology.
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? No.  However, we do block social media access for all students while on district premises.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents “opt-out”?

No, they could not “opt-out.”
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? The San Benito CISD’s Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) “Filtering” section.  However, nothing about social media monitoring is included in the verbiage: https://www.sbcisd.net/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=893329&type=d&pREC_ID=1891064
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? The district’s Technology Department had access to reports and alerts generated.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm?
No incidents were reported.
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how?
No.  It served only for web filtering and social media monitoring.

Who recommended it to you? What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? It was purchased after a Governor’s report on school safety. The primary purpose of our use of Go Guardian is for content filtering.  Content filtering is required on student devices per CIPA compliance. I cannot confirm for you an original purchase date.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) Content filtering is the primary use but it is also leveraged for explicit and self-harm alerts as well as theft recovery.
Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? Go Guardian is still used as content filtering is required on student devices per CIPA compliance. Social Sentinel is no longer used.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members? Go Guardian is used on all Chromebooks.
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? The district does no monitoring of students’ social media.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""? Yes, families are informed annually in the district ‘s Acceptable User Policy and are required to acknowledge as part of registration\verification processes. An “opt-out” is part of these processes.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? The district has Acceptable Use Policies for district officials.
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? A limited number of authorized personnel have access which aligns to their job duties. When we had Social Sentinel, the Spring Branch ISD Police Department command staff received any alerts.  No alerts received were actual threats to our District.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? No.
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? As stated above, this technology is used for theft recovery.

What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? Texas City ISD has never used Gaggle.

What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) This type of technology provides early warning on buzz words describing violent activity (harm to self or other).  Keys words such as: fight, gun, shoot, sucide etc.  However, we will not discuss in detail how it is used due to Under Title 5, USC 522 we decline to discuss the tactics, technique and procedures used in the protection of our students and staff.  

Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? We never used Gaggle.

Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members? The digital threat assessment is used on all students, staff and local community members who make threatening statements that could affect the security and safety of the district in accordance with Senate Bill 11.

Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? The district used Social Sentinel for a short period of time in 2018 for the purpose of social media monitoring. Senate Bill 11, passed during the 86th Texas Legislative Session in 2019, added Section 115 to Chapter 37 of the Texas Education Code. This section requires all public school districts and open-enrollment charter schools in Texas to have a trained, multidisciplinary threat assessment team whose purpose is to identify, assess, report, and manage individuals who make threats of violence, or who exhibit harmful, threatening, or violent behavior. The team also gathers and analyzes data to determine the level of risk and appropriate intervention. Digital Threat Assessment (DTA) was developed to address the evolving technology challenges that currently face our schools. Most aspects of school safety and threats to schools now involve a social media or other online component.

Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""? Students and parents were only told we monitored social media as part of our security plan but we did not share details how.  In accordance with Title 5, USC 522 we decline to discuss the tactics, technique and procedures used in the protection of our students and staff.  

What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? There are no board policies that address the use.

Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? Up to 4 staff members in technology and emergency management/security

Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? Yes, the technology has helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm. However, we decline to discuss any specifics out of the privacy protection of our students and staff.  

Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? No

Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances. The use of technology has uncovered information that has led to students being disciplined. However, we are not able to discuss student discipline."" - Melissa Tortorici, Director of Communications"

It was another layer of protection for our students. I am alerted of any inappropriate behavior which then is addressed by the principals, and also alerts us on any self-harm which is dealt with immediately. Who recommended it to you? I learned about it at a technology leaders’ conference. What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? There wasn’t a specific incident, but we wanted to give parents the assurance  that students are being protected to the best of our ability.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) We do not monitor social media, as our district does not allow the use of social media on campus. We use Gaggle to monitor email, Google Drive, and Microsoft One Drive.
Do you still use this technology? Yes, definitely. If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? If we can help even one student who is threatening self-harm or harm to others, or to guide a student to go down “the right path,” it is well worth the cost. I can say, the price is very reasonable.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? We only use Gaggle to monitor files and email for 6th-12th grades. I also have a content filter and keylogger that monitors for inappropriate material for all students and staff. Is it used on any employees or community members? Not Gaggle; it is only for students grades 6 – 12.
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? We use Lightspeed Relay as our content filter for all web traffic. I use Aristotle K12 to monitor all keystrokes; it reports on any inappropriate words in files, emails, and files. These two resources are used for all students and staff.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? Yes. If so, how? It is part of our Acceptable Use Policy. If students and parents do not agree to the AUP, the student cannot use any school-owned technology. Could students or parents ""opt-out""? Not really; if they do, their child cannot use any school technology.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? They don’t use school technology other than an email account. They are bound by the same rules in our AUP.
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? Gaggle reports are only sent to me (director of technology) and the corresponding principal and counselor. The keylogger and Lightspeed Relay reports are only accessible by the technology department staff.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? We have been alerted to a couple of possible self-harm issues. The counselor and principal reached out to the students and parents. They were able to get the students the mental-health assistance needed.
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? Yes  If so, how? We have used it to discuss inappropriate behavior (i.e. accessing inappropriate material off campus using a school email account.)
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? Yes  If so, please describe these specific instances. We have had a couple of students try to access inappropriate material using a school-issued email account. This is directly against our Acceptable Use Policy, so the students were given on-campus detention based on our discipline guidelines."" -Suzette McIntyre, Director of Technology"

ONCE FUNDING APPROVAL IS RECEIVED, FAX PO 309 665 0171 AS PER MICHAEL GRAS","$3,240 ",,"Why did the District purchase this technology? Who recommended it to you? What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? We purchased it for the safety of our students. I do not recall who recommended it to us since it has been in place for over 15 years. No issue occurred. We were being proactive.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) Email monitoring, web filter, social media monitoring for self harm only and then only if it is posted from a school owned device, chromebook management, web history tracking, device location tracking of the device for theft
Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it?
Yes; It is worth it because it has detected students reaching out for help in a number of areas. If it saves one student's life, it is worth every penny. 
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members?
It is not ""used on students."" It is used on school owned student devices and accounts. If they have a school provided email account or use a school owned device, those protections are in place. 
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email?
No 
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""?  Yes, all stakeholders were informed; parent meetings are held; students are introduced or reminded at the beginning of each school year when the acceptable use is reviewed; there is no opt-out option for school owned accounts or device filtering and monitoring since some of those items are required under federal law for eRate funding.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials?
I am not sure what this question is asking. 
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? The CTO only. Then, if it violates the acceptable use policy or is harmful to a student, the proper campus and district authorities are made aware.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? Not with specifics due to privacy laws, but several students over the years have been able to receive the help they need because of these tools in place.
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? I wouldn't know what else to use them for. That is their intended purpose. The only thing you left out is theft of the device, and yes we have had to use the tracking to recover a couple of devices over the years. We provide the location to the police department for handling. 
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances. In general terms, yes. Students have been disciplined. Due to student privacy laws, I will not discuss specifics."" - Scott S. Floyd, Chief Technology Officer"

CIPA requires that school districts monitor the online activity of minors and provide education to minors regarding appropriate online behavior. This information is provided to parents at the beginning of each school year in the Acceptable Use Policy. Each student must have a parent-signed Acceptable Use Policy on file before receiving access to district devices or internet services. These measures have proven to be successful.
