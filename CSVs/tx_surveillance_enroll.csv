What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? In our continued efforts to keep our students safe, AISD purchased content monitoring software, GoGuardian and Gaggle, without any instigating incidents.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.)
On district-owned technological devices, GoGuardian software proactively identifies students at risk of self-harm. Gaggle is another student safety solution that is used to filter and monitor safe learning online. Students use Google products for Education, issued by AISD, consisting of Gmail, Meet, Calendar, Drive for storage, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms and Sites such as Canvas.
Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it?
Yes, we still use this technology because we find great value in both systems. We respond to students efficiently based on unsafe keywords that Gaggle and GoGuardian use to alert the Threat Assessment Coordinator. Both products have the ability to prioritize student needs by alert levels. The Threat Assessment Coordinator receives alerts for students that are both virtual and in-person. Alerts consist of drugs and alcohol, harassment, nudity, self-harm, and violence towards others.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members?
The technology is used with all students in the District.
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email?
No.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""?
Parents received a copy of AISD ‚Äòs Gaggle and GoGuardian Policy, as well as the Acceptable Usage Policy, outlining appropriate usage. A series of online community meetings were held throughout last year to inform parents and community members about the District‚'s monitoring policy. Students nor parents could ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù of monitoring student‚'s activity on district-issued technology devices or while logged into their district issued Google account.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials?

Who recommended it to you? What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology?  The Safety and Security team and Counseling Department wanted to take a proactive, preventative approach to the overall wellness of students and keeping children safe. Gaggle is one of the providers of preventative services that allow districts to be alerted to written statements made by students which indicate they are at risk.   There was no specific instigating incident that made the team purchase technology.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) Securely (sic) is used as a mobile device management platform. We utilize it to manage the application and settings on all district iPads, and provide teachers with a classroom management tool. They have the ability to lock student devices to either be disabled or restricted to a certain website during class. This functionality is disabled outside of school hours. Gaggle is utilized to monitor CFB issued student email or Google Drive accounts and send alerts based on certain types of content, such as pornography, or treats of violence or self-harm.    
Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? Yes. It continues to alert us to students at risk of imminent harm.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members? All students only
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? Designated staff monitor social media.  We also use Meltwater services as a monitoring device.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""? Yes. Notification of monitoring is in the CFBISD Student Responsible Technology Use Guidelines. Parents agree to this form when enrolling their student each year.  The only opt out available, is an opt out of using district technology altogether.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? CQ (Local) and CQ (Legal) FFF (Legal and Local) FFEB (Legal)FFB (Legal)FFH (Legal and Local)Student Handbook (pages 46-47)
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? Gaggle: The District Gaggle Team, a subgroup of the District Threat Assessment Team, as members of the Safe and Supportive Schools Program receive Gaggle alerts.  Processes are in place to coordinate the appropriate response based on the type of Gaggle alert and the content reported. 
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? There have been multiple incidents in which students at risk have been identified and imminent self-harm was avoided.  Incidents include letters with students saying good-bye to loved ones with plans to take one‚'s life, detailed plans of minors to run away and meet individuals they have met online, and plans to self-injure.  
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? Gaggle: We use this technology to manage the student accounts and data through filters programmed to check data against certain key words in order to identify possible signs of suicide ideation, self-harm, harm to others, signs of depression, exploitation, bullying, and inappropriate content that is in violation of the student use of technology agreement. This is in an effort to align the in-person school safety culture with the online learning environment.
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances. Students who are found in possession of inappropriate content on their district technology or accounts are referred to campus administrators for appropriate disciplinary procedures aligned with district policies."" - Dawn Parnell, Chief Communications Officer"

We are not using any social media monitoring or email service at this time."" ""Why did the District purchase this technology? Who recommended it to you? What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? Following the Santa Fe High School tragedy, which is a neighboring school district from Clear Creek ISD, we explored ways to identify potential threats to the school system that may present themselves through social media. I do not recall of a particular person who introduced us to this service. Attached you will find documents related to the contract.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) Clear Creek ISD did not receive information that was helpful which is why it terminated the service within the first year of use.  We found the use of an anonymous reporting system to be of great value which is what we use today.
Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? See above.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members? No
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? No, we are not actively monitoring student social media accounts or emails. If information is shared to us through our Anonymous Alerts system and warrants follow up, we will investigate. However, Clear Creek ISD is not monitoring students‚' social media or district email accounts.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""? Since we don‚'t monitor their social media accounts or email, no notification is necessary.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? We are  not using this technology.
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? Director of Safe Schools had access to Social Sentinel.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? No.  
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? No
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances. No""

Who recommended it to you? What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? As a school district, we are required to maintain a content filter for our Internet traffic to meet CIPA compliance. We learned about Securly in 2017 and took it for a test drive! We were impressed with many of its features and ease of use, and implemented it a few months later.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) Securly is used for our content filter. It also has the ability to identify certain triggers in our student email and will forward those triggers (verbiage that includes weapons, fights, bullying, suicidal expression, etc.) This product also allows us to place our lost/stolen/unreturned devices in LOST mode which will shut down access and provide us with a GPS locator.   
Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? We still use this product.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members? This is used for all Internet traffic and all Chromebooks.
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? We have used Social Sentinel for social media monitoring.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""? There is not an ""opt out"" for content filtering as it is a requirement for districts to utilize content filtering or lose E-Rate funding.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? This technology is implemented and managed by the Executive Director of Technology and the Network Administrator. No one else has access to the back end of the content filtering/monitoring functionality.
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? Please see Q#7. When Securly sends a notification regarding a self-harm or harm-to-others concern, the Executive Director of Technology forwards the alert to the proper campus administrators for follow-up.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? I KNOW that this service has alerted us to several students talking about and/or threatening self-harm. I firmly believe that our interventions have prevented multiple tragedies.  
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? We piloted Securly Classroom last spring and plan to implement this fall. It is an add-on module, totally separate from the content filter, that provides teachers with the ability to see and lock their students' Chromebook screens while they are giving instructions, and provides an easier way to push out URLs for instruction. During the pilot phase, it greatly increased students' time on task and minimized their tendency to open non-instructional websites.
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances. Securly has not led to any disciplinary actions in our school district."" -Travis Young, Assistant Superintendant of Student Services"

""Parents were notified of the use of Gaggle in the general safety letter sent home.  I have included the information from the letter (this was last year's letter):
  The following are just some of the steps we implement to ensure that our learning environments are as safe and secure as possible: ‚óè Lockdown, evacuation, shelter, and fire emergency drills are practiced a minimum of once per semester to ensure readiness for a variety of scenarios. ‚óè School Resource Officers are assigned at campuses. ‚óè Visitor entry to schools is limited to secured main entrances that require entry through the main office. ‚óè STOPIt Anonymous Reporting App available to students, staff, and parents. ‚óè Gaggle network monitoring system. ‚óè Camera surveillance  
No parents can't opt-out of Gaggle network monitoring.

Go Guardian is part of the monitoring and acceptable use policy when using EISD equipment."" -Nikita Russell, Executive Director of Public Relations"

Who recommended it to you? What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? Response #1 - There was no instigating incident that caused Irving ISD to purchase Gaggle. Irving ISD is and has always been very concerned with the health and safety of our students. This concern was the reason why Irving ISD started investigating applications that would allow us to proactively assist in preventing student self-harm, violence to others, and Drug & Alcohol abuse. We were looking for a solution that would be secure, accurate, low maintenance, and easy to use. The Gaggle solution met Irving ISD‚'s requirements and expectations.

GoGuardian was purchased as part of our security protection for students to be able to CIPA filter student devices as required by law. After researching multiple programs and doing some trials, we decided GoGuardian provided the best protection and monitoring capability for our district's needs. Social Sentinel was purchased as another piece of our security protection for our students to monitor Social Media posts in our area to notify us if any SM post mentioned any kind of threat to our schools.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) GoGuardian has multiple pieces: A CIPA web filter for district Chromebooks that are checked out to students for both on campus and at home protection, Theft Recovery in the event a Chromebook is stolen or missing, and web history tracking. A Chromebook Monitor for teachers to use during their class times that allows teachers to monitor student activity during the class to aid in keeping students on task. A monitor of student activity that can notify us if a student is either writing about or researching suicide or self-harm. Social Sentinel is a social media monitor.
Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? GoGuardian: We do still use GoGuardian. It does a great job protecting students via the CIPA filter, aides teachers during class time to monitor students and keep them on task, and provides a layer of protection and prevention of student self-harm and suicide. Social Sentinel: We are discussing at this time as to whether the system provided enough actionable information to merit continuing to use it.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members? GoGuardian: Used on all District owned Chromebooks, whether used by students or staff. Staff filters are not as strict as student filters, but are still a minimum of CIPA filtering. Social Sentinel: Is not used on any specific group, it merely monitors all social media that mentions potential harm to any of our schools. 
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? We also use a web filter within our network to protect all staff and students internet browsing.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""? Parents and students are informed annually that we use GoGuardian and our web filter for their protection as required by CIPA and State Law. We have an Acceptable Use Policy that all parents must sign that informs them that we filter all internet access. The only way to ""opt out"" is for a parent to choose not to allow their student internet access, which will then not allow that student to use a computing device for school work, but would instead force that student to only be able to use paper assignments. 
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? We have an Acceptable Use Policy in place for all staff. Beyond that we do have procedures for the staff to follow when using this technology.
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? GoGuardian: The Director of Technology manages these programs and receives alerts and reports. Campus Principals also receive alerts involving students who are attempting to access sites that are against filtering policies, and Counselors receive alerts of potential self-harm and suicide. As needed, the Director of Technology shares information with the Superintendent, Principals, Assistant Principals, and Counselors based on the individual situation. Social Sentinel: Alerts are sent to the Director of Technology. If there is an actionable threat, the appropriate Administrators and Officials are contacted.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? GoGuardian: We have received potential self-harm notifications that allowed Administrators to contact parents and intervene and get help for students who were contemplating self-harm. These have even come over a weekend and allowed notification of the parents to prevent the possible self-harm while students weren't at school. Social Sentinel: While there have been no actual threats that have been reported, we have received reports of social media mentions of our city or school in conjunction with terminology that appeared violent or threatening to the school, but was actually slang being used in reference to other events such as sporting events. Ex. ""yo Kirbyville is killin' it""
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? GoGuardian: Allows us to track missing or stolen devices in order to locate and attempt to recover them. Social Sentinel: No
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances. GoGuardian: Yes, if a student is attempting to access sites or information that is in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy or the Student Code of Conduct, or if a student is misusing the technology or bullying others, then they are contacted by an Assistant Principal or Principal to discuss the situation and administer disciplinary action as needed. Social Sentinel: No"

While in theory this was a positive concept, the use of AI (artificial intelligence) left it up to a system to determine the need for intervention.  At the end of the pilot, it was determined that the best method of support for students and families was direct contact at school, teaching and modeling ‚Äúsee something, say something‚Äù and rich community resources to connect students and families to for support when not at school (i.e. tip lines, 24 hour hotlines, mental health resources). In addition, we replaced this software with an app that students utilize as a digital mood meter. The outcome of a student sharing how they are feeling triggers both supportive content by way of a 1‚Äì2-minute video on pro-social, healthy coping skills as well as triggering an alert for the counselor to check in with that student and see what level of support is needed. While Lewisville ISD has a rich and well-developed protocol for reactive situations, we also firmly believe in the benefit of teaching prevention skills as a protective factor.

""The use of a service like Social Sentinel was one of several recommendations from a task force that included parent representatives, school officials, and public safety officials, which was established in the aftermath of a school shooting in Texas with the purpose of to identifying ways to keep our students safer."" - John Kuhn, Superintendent"

The technology was purchased to use for one year ‚Äì from approximately February 2017 to February 2018.  It was for a Migrant Education Program student device initiative intended to provide out of district web content filtering.  Our team met with McAllen ISD representatives, as they were using it at the time, to discuss their implementation of the technology. There were no incidents that prompted the purchase of this technology.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) Our use of the technology was limited to the following:  web filtering, web history tracking, location tracking, and social media monitoring.

Another was that the school district‚'s web content filter was updated to support out of district filtering so there was no need for two filtering services.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members? It was used only for the Migrant Education Program‚'s ‚Äúone to one‚Äù student device initiative through which migrant students were supplied with either an Apple Macbook Pro or an iPad.  Other district students and staff were not filtered or monitored by this technology.
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? No.  However, we do block social media access for all students while on district premises.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù? The San Benito CISD‚'s Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) ‚ÄúFiltering‚Äù section (https://www.sbcisd.net/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=893329&type=d&pREC_ID=1891064) was included on the device checkout agreement, indicating that devices were subject to filtering.  No, they could not ‚Äúopt-out.‚Äù
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? The San Benito CISD‚'s Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) ‚ÄúFiltering‚Äù section.  However, nothing about social media monitoring is included in the verbiage: https://www.sbcisd.net/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=893329&type=d&pREC_ID=1891064
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? The district‚'s Technology Department had access to reports and alerts generated.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm?
No incidents were reported.
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how?
No.  It served only for web filtering and social media monitoring.
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances.

What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) This type of technology provides early warning on buzz words describing violent activity (harm to self or other).  Keys words such as: fight, gun, shoot, sucide etc.  However, we will not discuss in detail how it is used due to Under Title 5, USC 522 we decline to discuss the tactics, technique and procedures used in the protection of our students and staff.  

Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? We never used Gaggle.

Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members? The digital threat assessment is used on all students, staff and local community members who make threatening statements that could affect the security and safety of the district in accordance with Senate Bill 11.

Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? The district used Social Sentinel for a short period of time in 2018 for the purpose of social media monitoring. Senate Bill 11, passed during the 86th Texas Legislative Session in 2019, added Section 115 to Chapter 37 of the Texas Education Code. This section requires all public school districts and open-enrollment charter schools in Texas to have a trained, multidisciplinary threat assessment team whose purpose is to identify, assess, report, and manage individuals who make threats of violence, or who exhibit harmful, threatening, or violent behavior. The team also gathers and analyzes data to determine the level of risk and appropriate intervention. Digital Threat Assessment (DTA) was developed to address the evolving technology challenges that currently face our schools. Most aspects of school safety and threats to schools now involve a social media or other online component.

Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""? Students and parents were only told we monitored social media as part of our security plan but we did not share details how.  In accordance with Title 5, USC 522 we decline to discuss the tactics, technique and procedures used in the protection of our students and staff.  

What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? There are no board policies that address the use.

Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? Up to 4 staff members in technology and emergency management/security

Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? Yes, the technology has helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm. However, we decline to discuss any specifics out of the privacy protection of our students and staff.  

Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? No

Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances. The use of technology has uncovered information that has led to students being disciplined. However, we are not able to discuss student discipline."" - Melissa Tortorici, Director of Communications"

It was another layer of protection for our students. I am alerted of any inappropriate behavior which then is addressed by the principals, and also alerts us on any self-harm which is dealt with immediately. Who recommended it to you? I learned about it at a technology leaders‚' conference. What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? There wasn‚'t a specific incident, but we wanted to give parents the assurance  that students are being protected to the best of our ability.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) We do not monitor social media, as our district does not allow the use of social media on campus. We use Gaggle to monitor email, Google Drive, and Microsoft One Drive.
Do you still use this technology? Yes, definitely. If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it? If we can help even one student who is threatening self-harm or harm to others, or to guide a student to go down ‚Äúthe right path,‚Äù it is well worth the cost. I can say, the price is very reasonable.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? We only use Gaggle to monitor files and email for 6th-12th grades. I also have a content filter and keylogger that monitors for inappropriate material for all students and staff. Is it used on any employees or community members? Not Gaggle; it is only for students grades 6 ‚Äì 12.
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? We use Lightspeed Relay as our content filter for all web traffic. I use Aristotle K12 to monitor all keystrokes; it reports on any inappropriate words in files, emails, and files. These two resources are used for all students and staff.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? Yes. If so, how? It is part of our Acceptable Use Policy. If students and parents do not agree to the AUP, the student cannot use any school-owned technology. Could students or parents ""opt-out""? Not really; if they do, their child cannot use any school technology.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? They don‚'t use school technology other than an email account. They are bound by the same rules in our AUP.
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? Gaggle reports are only sent to me (director of technology) and the corresponding principal and counselor. The keylogger and Lightspeed Relay reports are only accessible by the technology department staff.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? We have been alerted to a couple of possible self-harm issues. The counselor and principal reached out to the students and parents. They were able to get the students the mental-health assistance needed.
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? Yes  If so, how? We have used it to discuss inappropriate behavior (i.e. accessing inappropriate material off campus using a school email account.)
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? Yes  If so, please describe these specific instances. We have had a couple of students try to access inappropriate material using a school-issued email account. This is directly against our Acceptable Use Policy, so the students were given on-campus detention based on our discipline guidelines."" -Suzette McIntyre, Director of Technology"

I can say, the price is very reasonable.
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? We only use Gaggle to monitor files and email for 6th-12th grades. I also have a content filter and keylogger that monitors for inappropriate material for all students and staff. Is it used on any employees or community members? Not Gaggle; it is only for students grades 6 ‚Äì 12.
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email? We use Lightspeed Relay as our content filter for all web traffic. I use Aristotle K12 to monitor all keystrokes; it reports on any inappropriate words in files, emails, and files. These two resources are used for all students and staff.
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? Yes. If so, how? It is part of our Acceptable Use Policy. If students and parents do not agree to the AUP, the student cannot use any school-owned technology. Could students or parents ""opt-out""? Not really; if they do, their child cannot use any school technology.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials? They don‚'t use school technology other than an email account. They are bound by the same rules in our AUP.
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? Gaggle reports are only sent to me (director of technology) and the corresponding principal and counselor. The keylogger and Lightspeed Relay reports are only accessible by the technology department staff.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? We have been alerted to a couple of possible self-harm issues. The counselor and principal reached out to the students and parents. They were able to get the students the mental-health assistance needed.
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? Yes  If so, how? We have used it to discuss inappropriate behavior (i.e. accessing inappropriate material off campus using a school email account.)
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? Yes  If so, please describe these specific instances. We have had a couple of students try to access inappropriate material using a school-issued email account. This is directly against our Acceptable Use Policy, so the students were given on-campus detention based on our discipline guidelines."" -Suzette McIntyre, Director of Technology"

What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.)

Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it?
Yes; It is worth it because it has detected students reaching out for help in a number of areas. If it saves one student's life, it is worth every penny. 
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members?
It is not ""used on students."" It is used on school owned student devices and accounts. If they have a school provided email account or use a school owned device, those protections are in place.

Yes, all stakeholders were informed; parent meetings are held; students are introduced or reminded at the beginning of each school year when the acceptable use is reviewed; there is no opt-out option for school owned accounts or device filtering and monitoring since some of those items are required under federal law for eRate funding.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials?
I am not sure what this question is asking. 
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? The CTO only. Then, if it violates the acceptable use policy or is harmful to a student, the proper campus and district authorities are made aware.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? Not with specifics due to privacy laws, but several students over the years have been able to receive the help they need because of these tools in place.

WHITE OAK ISD,2016-2017,Securly,1503,5/26/17,Securly Anywhere Filtering Part# securly Fax PO to Vendor 855-727-5939,"$5,000 ",,"Why did the District purchase this technology? Who recommended it to you? What, if any, instigating incident was there that made you purchase this technology? We purchased it for the safety of our students. I do not recall who recommended it to us since it has been in place for over 15 years. No issue occurred. We were being proactive.
What exactly does/did this technology do for the District? (Ie. social media monitoring, email monitoring, web filter, Chromebook management, web history tracking, location tracking etc. Please include all functionality your district has access to with these technologies.) Email monitoring, web filter, social media monitoring for self harm only and then only if it is posted from a school owned device, chromebook management, web history tracking, device location tracking of the device for theft
Do you still use this technology? If not, why did you stop? If so, why is it still worth it?
Yes; It is worth it because it has detected students reaching out for help in a number of areas. If it saves one student's life, it is worth every penny. 
Is this technology used on all students in the District or just a certain subset? Is it used on any employees or community members?
It is not ""used on students."" It is used on school owned student devices and accounts. If they have a school provided email account or use a school owned device, those protections are in place. 
Did/does/will the District use any other technology tool (ie. Social Sentinel, Gaggle, Securly, Go Guardian, Geofeedia, Media Sonar, LightSpeed Relay etc.) for the purpose of monitoring students' social media or email?
No 
Were students or their parents ever notified or informed in any way about the use of this technology? If so, how? Could students or parents ""opt-out""?  Yes, all stakeholders were informed; parent meetings are held; students are introduced or reminded at the beginning of each school year when the acceptable use is reviewed; there is no opt-out option for school owned accounts or device filtering and monitoring since some of those items are required under federal law for eRate funding.
What policies did/do you have in place specifically governing the use of this technology by District officials?
I am not sure what this question is asking. 
Who all has/had access to reports/alerts generated by this technology? The CTO only. Then, if it violates the acceptable use policy or is harmful to a student, the proper campus and district authorities are made aware.
Can you name a specific instance where this technology helped prevent an instance of imminent violence or self-harm? Not with specifics due to privacy laws, but several students over the years have been able to receive the help they need because of these tools in place.
Have you ever used this technology for purposes other than the prevention of self-harm or violence? If so, how? I wouldn't know what else to use them for. That is their intended purpose. The only thing you left out is theft of the device, and yes we have had to use the tracking to recover a couple of devices over the years. We provide the location to the police department for handling. 
Has the use of this technology ever led to a student being disciplined in any way (including but not limited to being arrested, expelled, suspended or put in detention)? If so, please describe these specific instances. In general terms, yes. Students have been disciplined. Due to student privacy laws, I will not discuss specifics."" - Scott S.
