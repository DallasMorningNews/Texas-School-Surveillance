# Texas School Surveillance

SQL queries, DBs, CSVs, Shapefile and Tableau files used to report <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/investigations/2021/09/02/texas-schools-are-watching-millions-of-students-online-often-without-their-knowledge-or-consent/">this story</a> for <i>The Dallas Morning News</i>.

The district enrollment data were obtained from the U.S. Dept. of Education. The data on which schools used this tech came from GovSpend's purchasing database. You can read the full comment from each school district that responded in the tx_surveillance_enroll csv, which was used to generate the table embedded in the story. 

All SQL queries and visualizations were created by me.
